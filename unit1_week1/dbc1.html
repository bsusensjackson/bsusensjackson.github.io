		<h3>Welcome to my web page. Unelegeant as it may seem, much thought has been given to it.</h3>
		<h5>What have you done before this?</h5>
		<p>Let me being by saying that it is exciting to be coding again.  I haven't written anything in HTML in about four years. <span class="italic"> Four years! </span>  The last page that I made I used <strong> Dreamweaver </strong> as a crutch.  This way is much more fun. </p>
		<h6>Oh yeah? What about before that?</h6>
		<p>Before that, I coded using HTML 4.0.  Most of the pages that I made seemed dense and verbose.  There were tables everywhere!  Now there are almost no tables, unless of course, I want to organize data with one. Getting used to the workflow of HTML5 with CSS is new, but the resuling code is much cleaner to work with. </p>
		<h4>As they say, hang in there baby!</h4>
