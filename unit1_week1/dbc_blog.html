		<h2>Websites that I like.</h2>
		<h3>Apple.com</h3>
		<p>Apple has always had a way with design, and their website is no different.  When the user first loads up their main page, she is presented with a visually pleasing, intuitive experience.  The main website layout, from my perspective, has not undergone any radical redesigns over the last 10 years, however.  The user is greeted by a main body element that blends image and text to draw the eye to it first.  Apple does not drown you in choices with their nav-menu, either.  They know the things (iTunes, the iPad, the Apple Store) that you are most likely to want to access by coming to their website, and display them prominently at the top. 
		<p>Though I own many Apple products, I have never actually purchased any of them through the Apple Online Store.  I use the store to view demos on their products and get information before buying, but have always visited an Apple store for the actual purchase.  I suppose I'm just old fashioned in that regard (and the price is the same.)  With Best Buy and Amazon, however, the process is reversed:  Best Buy frequently is the showroom for Amazon.com... </p>
		<p>In a way, their page is deceptively simple, much like their devices.  You could almost say that it is elegant in its simplicity.  Images dominate the experience, people are not drowned in "Walls of Text".  I remember hearing that you don't want the user to have to click more than three times to get to the content that they want to access, with Apple this seems to be more of a "two click" max value.  The idea of power in elegence leads me to my next point...
		<h3>Google.com</h3>
		<p>I remember visiting Google.com for the first time in the 5th Grade, and being relatively bemused at how simple it was. My experience with web sites up until that point had been centered around sites like Yahoo which were much more dense and wordy.  Google.com has four main things that you are aware of, centered in the middle of the page:  The Google.com Logo, a text field that you can type into, and the option to either "Search" or "Feel Lucky".  At the top right header, of course, there is the option to Sign In and expand upon the Google experience by personalizing results and accessing Gmail or your Google Calendar, but the eye is continutally drawn back to the centered, multi-colored Google logo.  It is reassuring in its simplicity, as if to say "Ask Me Anything, I don't mind."  People have questions, they need answers, and Google provides those answers.</p>
		<p>Though Google doesn't sell anything outright, I still have a Google account and openly contribute my search results to their market data on the 25-34 year old demographic.  I often think about how much I rely on Google: If I don't know the answer to something outright, I Google it.  I synch up my Apple device to my Google calendar and use it to manage meetings.  I use Google Hangout to coordinate things with people that I work with, and I use the Google+ community extensively for Dev Bootcamp related things. 
		<h3>Reddit.com</h3>
		<p>Ah yes, the black hole of afternoons, the sink drain that collects everything that the web tries to throw away.  Reddit - social media for those who have a distate for social media, who enjoy anomynimity but not <span class="italic"> too much </span> anomynimity (a la 4chan) without any accountability from your peers (with Karma). 
		Reddit creates a way for people to spread content and ideas, it gives a way for people to connect and still remain safely behind a screen name.  And Reddit has its own cliques and social convetions.  It is a way for people to get access to content that they don't get through email or through Facebook, and doesn't come with the pressures of adding a network of friends (that you may or may not know in real life) and being subjected to their vacation photos.</p>
		<p>Most of Reddit's allure comes from its ability to waste time and allow the user to mildly amuse himself by having access to an ever changing display of content.  Reddit's front page is never the same as it was an hour ago, and the primary focus of the body of the website is dedicated to the news feed of whatever subreddit you happen to be in.</p>
		<p>It is because of this focus constantly shifting content that makes Reddit so... addicting.  That and the inline comment format and the slight release of dopamine that one gets from accumulating "Karma" (by having others deem your contributions to be worthy and "Upvoting Them"), account for the base of the websites' popularity. </p>
		<p>Reddit's design is simple, though it is "busier" than the previous two sites that I listed.  It is not selling anything, per se, but users have the option to "gift" others Reddit "gold" (for especially superlative contributions) for the price of $4.00 USD, which helps pay for Reddit's server time.  I have never bought any Reddit Gold for anyone, though I have considered it on some occasions, perhaps if my bank account had a bit more "padding" for charitable pursuits I would act more generously in that regard. </p>
