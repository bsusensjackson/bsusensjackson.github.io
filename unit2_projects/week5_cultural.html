  <h2>An Issue in Tech // &quot;The Rockstar&quot;</h2>
  <p>Embarking on this new journey to become a web developer, I cannot help but try and relate some of the things that I read about  back to my previous experiences (in both education and various jobs that I&#39;ve had) - one term that I keep coming across is: &quot;Rockstar Programmer&quot;.</p>
  <p>I am bemused by this term for a number of reasons but mainly I find myself asking: what exactly is a rockstar programmer and what does it mean to be one?</p>
  <p>After all, I&#39;m changing careers from working at cocktail bars, where if you frequent them you may be unlucky enough to meet what has been deemed: the &quot;startender&quot;.  &quot;Startender&quot; means what it sounds - namely that the person is a &quot;rockstar&quot; behind the bar.  However, that term is often used as not one of endearment, and is equated with a selfish asshole who doesn&#39;t care at all about serving the guests at the bar but is instead absorbed by the &quot;idea&quot; of being a bartender than the actual task of it: getting overly involved in technical correction of making cocktails and knowing ingredients vs. you know, taking people&#39;s orders and serving them.</p>
  <p>See, calling someone a rockstar implies that they are really good at their job.  You have rockstar teachers, attorneys, mathematicians, (musicians) and of course, software engineers.  However,  with software engineers and bartenders usage of the word rockstar in this context (as mentioned above) also tends to come along with negative connotations: doesn&#39;t communicate well, is self involved, brash and overly critical.</p>
  <p>Then, I read a <a href="http://andytroutman.com/articles/2013/01/24/rockstar-programmers-are-not-assholes.html" target="_blank">blog post by Andy Troutman</a> on this subject.</p>
  <p>&quot;Here&#39;s the picture most of us have in our head right now: male, 23 years old, glasses and a t-shirt, a little rough around the edges. Doesnâ€™t always work well with others, because they are one with the code and of course you&#39;ll forgive them for that right? You have to suffer for your art! One can forgive a truly great developer some arrogance, perhaps a little unreliability. After all, this person is brilliant!&quot;
  <br>Being smart and opinionated are not bad traits, nor is confidence. But a true &#39;rockstar&#39; (I loath that word by the way) is more than that. The truly great engineers, the mythical 10X engineers, the ones that become principle developers and deliver amazing products - all of them understand the value of others. A rockstar developer isn&#39;t just personally productive, they are a productivity magnifier.&quot;</p>
  <p>Ultimately, I have to remember that in embarking on this new goal, I am not going to be great at it... at least for a long time. How could I be?  Also, I need to temper my fantasies and expectations by remembering that being a great engineer is just as much technical skill as it is interpersonal skill; and that I should constantly be pushing myself to be better in both of these regards.  Though I am not an expert on the field by any means, many projects fail because of stumbles in interpersonal relationships among the team, not necesarily because of technical skill. An emphasis on interpersonal skills as well as technical skills will be beneficial for the industry overall.  I want to be a rockstar, someday, but not be a smart asshole.  Also, I have to come to terms with where I am in the moment, (you don&#39;t become a great programmer overnight...) and remember that I am still learning and continue to push myself in both areas.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wherever you are is the entry point.&quot;</p>
