  <h2>Kitchen vs. Table Mindset</h2>
  <p>Coming from working in the restaurant industry, I greatly appreciated this talk with Shereef.  In this chat, he mentions the two most common types of mindsets that boots have when they come to Dev Bootcamp: a table mindset or a kitchen mindset.  At the table, one anticipates a package experience as a consumer; you are paying for real estate, you get what you order.  If that order comes out incorrectly, you complain about it and write a bad review on Yelp.  
In the kitchen, however, you are a creator.  You are under stress constantly, and you are bound to the members of the kitchen brigade that you are cooking with.  If something is wrong, you work to fix it.  You constantly do the impossible and are in the weeds constantly.  Yet somehow, you make it to the end of each day and are the better for it.</p>

<p>I admire people who achieve technical mastery of their chosen craft, because doing so implies that one has taken a great deal of care in their chosen pursuit.  One does not become a virtuoso through talent alone.  Of my many idols, one stands out:  Marco Pierre White.  For those not familiar with his name, he was the mentor to Gordon Ramsay, and held a reputation as being a wicked task master.  He was the one of the youngest chefs to ever win three Michelin stars (at the age of thirty-three) and the first British chef to do so.  Yet Marco, even during the height of his success, was behind the stove.  He wore a blue and white striped apron, which is the apron of the commis chef: it signifies that his entire team is still learning.</p>
<p>I have always found this contrast between kitchen tyrant and humble student to be fascinating; and certainly Marco has many traits that are not worth emulating.  Nevertheless, I find his attitude of staying hungry for knowledge even at the height of his success to be admirable.  It is the same attitude that pushed Joe Pass to pick up a guitar or kept Picasso in front of the canvas.  It is with that same attitude that I hope to approach my new career as a Software Developer, and to remember that &quot;we are always learning&quot;.</p>
