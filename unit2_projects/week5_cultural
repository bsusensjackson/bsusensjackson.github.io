  <h2>An Issue in Tech // &quot;The Rockstar&quot;</h2>
  <p>Embarking on this new journey to become a web developer, I cannot help but try and relate some of the things that I read about  back to my previous experiences (in both education and various jobs that I&#39;ve had) - one term that I keep coming across is: &quot;Rockstar Programmer&quot;.</p>
  <p>I am bemused by this term for a number of reasons but mainly I find myself asking: what exactly is a rockstar programmer and what does it mean to be one?</p>
  <p>After all, I&#39;m changing careers from working at cocktail bars, where if you frequent them you may be unlucky enough to meet what has been deemed: the &quot;startender&quot;.  &quot;Startender&quot; means what it sounds - namely that the person is a &quot;rockstar&quot; behind the bar.  However, that term is often used as not one of endearment, and is equated with a selfish asshole who doesnâ€™t care at all about serving the guests at the bar but is instead absorbed by the &quot;idea&quot; of being a bartender than the actual task of it: getting overly involved in technical correction of making cocktails and knowing ingredients vs. you know, taking people&#39;s orders and serving them.</p>
