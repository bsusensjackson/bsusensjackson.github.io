      <p>Pair Programming: Having two programmers working on one project. </p>
      <p>Having two sets of eyes on a code helps to mitigate any problems that may arise, and gives the benefit of combining the knowledge of two people.
         Two programmers can feed on each other, correcting the mistakes of the other, offering alternate suggestions and in the process, adding to each others knowledge
         of coding.  More and more often you see this being applied in the programming world 
         which is why Dev Bootcamp stresses it's importance during the duration oft the program.

      <p>
        Pair programming works via the Driver/Navigator dynamic.  The Navigator gives instructions
        and is responsible for the overarching structure and goals of the site.   The driver takes the instructions the 
        Navigator, actually typing out the code and naming the elements. He can provide feedback to the 
        Navigator, but ultimately the final decisions lay with the Navigator.
