  <p><h2>On Conflict...</h2></p>
  <p>Conflict is something that I have dealt with differently throughout various stages in my life.
  One thing that I have noticed is that I have a tendency to either want to withdraw from conflict or find alternate ways to handle conflict (maybe having a few too many drinks...)</p>
  <p>Most recently, I have had disagreements with someone based on money. However, I decided to take the bull by the horns, and present my reasons for spending money that I should have perhaps been more willing to save.  Afterwards, I listenend to what the other person's concerns were, and I agreed that moving forward I would make a more conscientious effort to save money, while also noting that though money is understandbily tight, I do have necessary purchases considering the lifestyle change that I am making right now.</p>
  <p>From this experience, I learned that it is best to try and remain open communication about feelings and not be overly-clandestine with how I am budgeting and what I am choosing to spend money on.  This helps avoid any unpleast surprises or unfortunate reprocussions for overspending down the road.  My new mantra moving forward is that it is always better to be proactive then force someone else to be reactive.</p>
