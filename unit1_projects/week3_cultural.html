  <h2>Pairing Sessions and Feedback</h2>
  <p>For the last two weeks, I&#39;ve had number of pairing sessions, two of them were guided.  Guided pairing sessions, so far, have been composed of this format: two peers of relatively the same skill are guided (loosely) through an exercise by an instructor.  Both pairing sessions went pretty smoothly, though for my second one my partner couldnâ€™t make it so I essentially paired up with the instructor to tackle the challenge.</p>
  <p>Before going into pairing sessions I&#39;ve noticed that I tend to be a little bit anxious.  This anxiety (for the most part) I think is actually a good thing, because it makes me focus on the task at hand (and try not to look like too much of an idiot in front of my partner and the instructor) by forcing me to do some groundwork before the session begins.  I&#39;ve noticed that once we get going, the instructors have done a good job of helping to ease any tension, and I focus on putting on my &quot;game face&quot; and getting my head in the game to complete the challenge.  I am sure that with more practice pairing will begin to become more natural and I will be a bit more relaxed while doing it.   I was particularly happy that the instructor for my second session seemed pleased with the progress that we made and made a nice comment about it.  This helped me re-energize and helped give me a push to go out and tackle some of the other weekly challenges (especially the group challenge). </p>
  <p>Writing feedback has also had a bit of a learning curve, but I come from a fairly feedback oriented family (both my mother and stepfather stress open lines of communication), so I&#39;m fairly comfortable with receiving (hopefully constructive) feedback from people.  Nevertheless, I have worked on trying to identify any emotions that come up when hearing/looking at people&#39;s feedback - I think I have a tendency to withdrawal or want to just avoid the problem, like saying Well this is going terribly, but I&#39;ll have a few beers later and just forget it.&quot; - so I will make sure to take note of when those feelings come up when I receive feedback in the future.</p>
  <p>One thing that I&#39;ve read about (which I learned about by talking to my friend who is a psychologist but transcends into any field) is that you never get frustrated at a person who is not understanding something that you are trying to explain to them.  Instead, it is more beneficial to look at how you are trying to explain something and modifying your approach/method of communication, as this will not only help the other person but also solidify your understanding of the subject.  I think that this ties in nicely with the concept of giving feedback, in that it is important to understand how to give feedback appropriately.  The most difficult thing that came up for me when writing feedback was making sure that my feedback was appropriately actionable and specific (e.g. making sure that the feedback is about things that the person can control or modify and be focused in enough to only deal with that one issue) but I am sure that I can hone this with more practice. </p>
