  <p><h2>Why Is JavaScript so Popular in Web Development?</h2></p>
  <p>JavaScript is a dynamic, object oriented programming language.  It was developed in the mid-nineties by Netscape to serve as a lightweight interpreted language, meaning (essentially) that can be  compiled directly in the browser and will work without putting too much of a strain on your computer/tablet/etc.  JavaScript is sometimes maligned because it never went through a full testing phase before being released, but it has grown into a powerful tool for all web developers to master.</p>
  <p>Despite some rough beginnings, JavaScript makes web pages more fun to be on.  It makes things interactive, which in today&#39;s world of shortening attention spans of users is practically a requirement to keep people interested in the content that you are showing them.  Take a look at the popularity of sites like <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">codeacademy</a> or <a href="http://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">codeschool</a>; they are popular because they teach you in an interactive environment - not just some boring Terminal window and some textbook!  (Those things can be fun too, of course, but are perhaps best introduced once you&#39;ve gotten your feet a little wet).    JavaScript also makes it possible for you to code up games for people to play in their web browsers - and everybody loves games!</p>
  <p>One important thing to remember is that JavaScript is not Java.  The easiest way to describe the relationship/difference between the two is that they both have the word &quot;Java&quot; in their name, they are fundamentally different in both design and concept!</p>
